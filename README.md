## Description

This webpage is an introduction to javascript and some new javascript functions.
My motivation for this project was simply just trying to understand a bit about how javascript is applied. It is still a bit confusing to me but I understand how these elements are strung together.
The challenge this week was literally understanding what everything meant (lol). It's a lot to get to grips with but all I need to do is revisit the previous lectures and I should understand things.
